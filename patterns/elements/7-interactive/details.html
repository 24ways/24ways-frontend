    <summary>How do I know which bone to choose?</summary>
    <p>Whether you want to give your dog a nylon bone, a real bone, or a rawhide bone, choose a bone that matches your dog&#8217;s chewing rate and chewing habits. You may also wish to consider your dog's size and choose a bone that best fits his mouth and teeth.</p>
